# LightJockey


### Goal:

An application that allows your Phillips Hue lights to be influenced by the music coming out of your Sonos speakers.


#### For developers:

To tell git to ignore your local changes to `light-jockey-settings.properties`, simply execute the following after modifying it:
```git update-index --assume-unchanged src/main/resources/light-jockey-settings.properties```
